-- You can add your own plugins here or in other files in this directory!
--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)
--
-- See the kickstart.nvim README for more information

-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following lua:
--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })

-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end
--
-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
--
-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
--
-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

return {
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

        delete = { text = '_' },
        topdelete = { text = 'â€¾' },
        changedelete = { text = '~' },
      },
    },
  },

      --  - yinq - [Y]ank [I]nside [N]ext [']quote
      --  - ci'  - [C]hange [I]nside [']quote
      require('mini.ai').setup { n_lines = 500 }

      -- Add/delete/replace surroundings (brackets, quotes, etc.)
      --
      -- - saiw) - [S]urround [A]dd [I]nner [W]ord [)]Paren

      -- - sr)'  - [S]urround [R]eplace [)] [']
      require('mini.surround').setup()

      -- Simple and easy statusline.
      --  You could remove this setup call if you don't like it,
      --  and try some other statusline plugin
      local statusline = require 'mini.statusline'
      statusline.setup()

      -- You can configure sections in the statusline by overriding their
      -- default behavior. For example, here we set the section for
      -- cursor location to LINE:COLUMN
      ---@diagnostic disable-next-line: duplicate-set-field
      statusline.section_location = function()
        return '%2l:%-2v'
      end
